## About
This folder contains the analysis of a **sample phishing email** (fake Bradesco ‚ÄúLivelo points expiring‚Äù campaign).  
The goal of this task was to analyze the raw email headers, URLs, and authentication checks **without opening links or attachments**, and to determine whether the email is phishing.

---

## Objectives
- Safely obtain and inspect a suspicious email.  
- Analyze email headers for sender spoofing.  
- Check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results.  
- Extract and verify embedded URLs.  
- Summarize indicators of compromise (IOCs).  
- Provide remediation recommendations.

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Collected the email sample** from the `phishing_pot` GitHub repo.  
2. **Analyzed headers** using MXToolbox / Google Admin Toolbox.  
   - Checked `From`, `Return-Path`, and `Authentication-Results`.  
3. **Verified SPF/DKIM/DMARC** ‚Üí all failed.  
4. **Extracted embedded URL**:  
   - Found `https://blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me/`.  
   - Checked with VirusTotal and WHOIS ‚Üí flagged as suspicious.  
5. **Confirmed sending IP** (`137.184.34.4`) ‚Üí DigitalOcean VPS, not a bank server.  
6. **Collected verdicts** from scanners (SpamAssassin, VirusTotal).  
7. **Documented findings** and recommendations.

---

## Results
- Email is **confirmed phishing**.  
- **Spoofed sender**: pretends to be Bradesco (`@atendimento.com.br`).  
- **Authentication failed**: SPF/DKIM/DMARC not valid.  
- **Suspicious URL**: unrelated `.me` domain.  
- **Originating IP**: not owned by Bradesco.  
- **Lure**: fake claim of loyalty points expiring to trick users into clicking.

## Findings
Key Indicators of Phishing:
- From: `"BANCO DO BRADESCO LIVELO" <banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br>`  
- Return-Path: `root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu...`  
- SPF: TempError, DKIM: none, DMARC: TempError

## Recommendations

- Block IP `137.184.34.4` and domain `blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me`.  
- Enhance filtering for spoofed `@atendimento.com.br`.  
- Educate users about reward/point-expiration phishing tactics.  
- Report sample to anti-phishing feeds and security team.
